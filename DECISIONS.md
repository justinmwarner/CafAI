# CafAI decisions log

Assumptions and decisions made during the unattended overnight build, newest
last within each section. Each entry says what was decided, why, and where the
evidence lives. "Repo wins" means a cloned source contradicted
`docs/RESEARCH.md` and the source was followed (see `docs/VERIFIED.md`).

## Process

- **D1. Commits use command-line git, not the interactive commit widget.** The
  editor's commit-proposal tool needs a human to approve each commit. The run
  is unattended and the brief says "never stop to ask" and "small commits", so
  commits are made with `git commit` on a fresh local repo that no other
  session touches. Nothing is pushed anywhere.
- **D2. Reference clones live outside the repo.** `crema/` and `.ref/*` are
  read-only research inputs and are git-ignored. Commit hashes are recorded in
  `docs/VERIFIED.md`.

## Stack and tooling

- **D3. MUI 9.4.0 + `@mui/x-chat` 9.0.0-alpha.18, pinned exactly.** MUI
  officially supports Chrome 117+, below which Decaid's oldest tablets sit
  (Chromium 91). Verified empirically instead of assumed: a probe app (MUI
  components, ChatBox with streaming send/reply, uPlot, idb, zod) was built
  with `target: chrome91` and loaded in a real Chromium 91.0.4469.0 (puppeteer
  9) with zero errors and a correct layout. So x-chat is used, behind our own
  `ChatSurface` wrapper; the core-MUI fallback was not needed. The smoke test
  lives in `tools/chrome91/` and runs in CI (informational job).
- **D4. Polyfills are usage-based.** `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` with
  `modernPolyfills: true` and `renderLegacyChunks: false` adds only the core-js
  polyfills the final bundle needs (e.g. `Array.prototype.at`). APIs core-js
  cannot polyfill (`crypto.randomUUID`, `AbortSignal.timeout/any`,
  `throwIfAborted`, static `Response.json`, async-iterating a `ReadableStream`)
  are banned by ESLint rules in `eslint.config.js`.
- **D5. TypeScript 5.9.3, not 6.x/7.x.** typescript-eslint 8.71 supports
  `<6.1.0` and openapi-typescript 7 needs `^5`. TS 5.9 is the newest version
  every tool accepts.
- **D6. MSW 2.15.0, not 3.x.** The v2 API (`http`, `HttpResponse`, `ws`,
  `setupWorker`, `setupServer`) is well known and stable; v3 was released
  recently and would add risk to an unattended run for no gain.
- **D7. `idb` instead of Dexie.** A 1 KB promise wrapper is enough for a
  handful of object stores behind repository interfaces, and keeps the bundle
  small on slow tablets.
- **D8. Vitest runs logic tests in Node; UI tests opt into jsdom** with a
  `// @vitest-environment jsdom` docblock (jsdom start-up is slow).
- **D9. Playwright viewports: 962x602 (DPR 1.33), 1280x800, 1920x1200.** The
  brief says "1280x800 minimum", but Decaid's own simulated devices show the
  real CSS viewports of Decent tablets are 962x602, 1007x602 and 1140x712
  (repo wins; `docs/verified/01-platform.md` section 10). A 1280x800 panel at
  DPR 1.33 *is* 962x602 CSS px, so CafAI is laid out for 962x602 and up.
- **D10. One production bundle, no lazy chunks.** Decaid replaces skin files
  in place on update while the page runs, so a lazily loaded hashed chunk can
  404. `scripts/release-zip.mjs` fails the release if any chunk other than the
  entry and the polyfills appears.

## Platform

- **D11. Manifest: `skin-manifest.json` (and an identical `manifest.json`).**
  Decaid reads `skin-manifest.json` first and falls back to `manifest.json`; it
  reads only `id`, `name`, `description`, `version`, all JSON strings (a
  numeric version silently hides the skin). The identical `manifest.json` is
  for older Decaid builds; it is ignored when `skin-manifest.json` exists. The
  id is `cafai` forever (it fixes the install folder, port, origin and so the
  saved data). Source of truth: `skin.config.json`.
- **D12. Exit control.** "Always a way back to the skin switcher": a
  persistent Exit button calls `window.decentApp.exitToDashboard()` when
  `window.__DECENT_HOST__` exists (the dashboard has the Skins page). In a
  plain browser it opens Decaid's settings UI, whose Web Interface section
  switches skins. In-skin skin switching is not implemented: it strands the
  page on a dead port.
- **D13. Settings link** is
  `http://${location.hostname}:8080/api/v1/plugins/settings.reaplugin/ui?backName=CafAI`
  as a full-page navigation (only `localhost:8080/api/v1/plugins/*` opens in
  place inside the app).
- **D14. API host:** `localStorage.reaHostname || location.hostname`, port
  8080, `ws://` for sockets (the streamline-js / MSL convention). No custom
  request headers on Decaid calls (CORS allow-list).
- **D15. Heartbeat:** `POST /api/v1/machine/heartbeat` on real input
  (pointerdown/keydown), throttled client-side to one call per 15 s (Decaid
  throttles at 5 s in code, the docs say 30 s).
- **D16. KV mirror namespace is `cafai`.** Never write DYE2's
  `dye2.reaplugin` keys; never write the API key, prompts or tokens to KV or
  to `console.*` (both are readable over the LAN).

## Profiles and coaching

- **D17. Profiles are sent with JSON numbers** (repo wins: GET returns numbers;
  only `version` "2" and enums are strings). Template JSON (strings, a de1app
  holdover) is parsed to numbers once at load.
- **D18. Always send the complete ten-key profile** (`version, title, notes,
  author, beverage_type, steps, target_volume, target_weight,
  target_volume_count_start, tank_temperature`). This covers Crema's "four
  required fields" fix (repo: only `tank_temperature` and
  `target_volume_count_start` are actually required, plus title and steps) and
  stops `PUT /workflow`'s deep merge from inheriting stale keys.
- **D19. Yield writes two places.** Stop-at-weight reads the workflow's
  `context.targetYield`, not the profile's `target_weight` (repo wins). The
  yield lever sets both, in the same `PUT /api/v1/workflow`.
- **D20. Templates: Blooming Espresso, D-Flow / default, Londonium** (copied
  byte-for-byte from Decaid's bundled profiles). Adaptive was rejected: 20
  steps, 18 coupled scan steps, `target_weight` 0. Lever bounds come from
  `docs/verified/03-profiles.md` section 9.
- **D21. v1 deduplicates to Decaid's bundled default.** Decaid's profile id is
  a hash of execution content only (title excluded), so "<Bean> v1" with every
  lever at its template value *is* the bundled default: `POST /profiles`
  returns the existing record. CafAI keeps its own per-bag version history in
  IndexedDB, treats Decaid ids as opaque pointers, and activates by PUTting
  the full profile (with the "<Bean> v1" title) to the workflow.
- **D22. The template tap is v1's confirmation.** Picking a template card is
  an explicit tap that creates and uploads v1; every later change (v2+) shows
  a plain-language diff and needs a separate Confirm tap.

## LLM

- **D23. A thin fetch + SSE client, not the Anthropic SDK.** The research
  found the SDK's entry pulls Node modules into browser bundles, and the
  client must run on Chromium 91 (no async-iterable streams). The client
  sends `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` and
  `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true`.
- **D24. Default model `claude-opus-5-5`** (named in the research brief as the
  current flagship), with Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5 and Fable 5.1 in the
  picker. RESEARCH lists "Sonnet 5.5"; the current model list has
  `claude-sonnet-5` and no 5.5 (verified against the API reference, repo
  wins). Opus 5.5 rejects forced tool use, so every request uses
  `tool_choice: auto` with `strict: true` tools, and every tool input is
  validated with zod before use.
- **D25. Conversations are append-only.** Assistant turns are stored exactly
  as returned (thinking blocks and signatures included) and replayed
  unchanged; current Claude models reject edited history.

## Licensing

- **D26. CafAI is GPL-3.0-only.** Crema says "GPLv3" without an "or later"
  grant, so code derived from it can only be distributed under GPL-3.0.
  Ported files carry `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only`, a line naming the
  Crema origin and copyright holder, and a "Modified for CafAI" line. Crema
  and its MimojaCafe lineage are credited in README and NOTICE.

## Crema conflicts

Where Crema's approach conflicts with the build rules, the rules win. The full
list with code pointers is `docs/CREMA_PORT_PLAN.md` section 9 (C1-C31); the
resolutions adopted:

- C1 licence: GPL-3.0-only (D26).
- C2-C5 free-form AI profiles, silent clamping, plausibility-only bounds,
  switching to any profile by title: replaced by template levers with hard
  bounds and per-iteration max deltas; invalid proposals are rejected back to
  the model as `is_error` tool results, never clamped silently.
- C6-C11 free-text JSON, no streaming, five providers, no retries/timeouts,
  no system prompt, hard-coded haiku default: strict tools + zod, streaming
  SSE, Anthropic only in the UI behind `LlmProvider`, retries with backoff,
  a stable cached system prompt, models in `src/llm/models.ts`.
- C12-C15 KV as primary store, mirror never written, key stored with
  settings, `crema` namespace: IndexedDB primary, mirror on every committed
  change, the key in a separate local-only secret store, `cafai` namespace.
- C16-C18 chrome78 target, no routing, normalised profile values: chrome91,
  hash routing, profiles built by patching the parsed template only at lever
  paths.
- C19 undo with explicit nulls (Decaid now rejects null `targetYield`): undo
  re-activates the previous version's full profile and its yield.
- C20-C21 four required fields, title-in-hash assumption: D18, D21.
- C22-C25 no heartbeat, exit hidden on focus screens, full re-render per
  sample, no silent-socket watchdog: D15, D12, an external telemetry store
  with selector subscriptions plus imperative uPlot updates, per-socket
  liveness handling.
- C26 shots captured on the client clock: canonical shot data comes from
  Decaid's `/api/v1/shots`; WebSocket frames are only for the live graph.
- C27-C28 prompt claiming web search, "seconds from first drop" mislabel: the
  prompt claims only attached tools; t = 0 is shot start and first drop is
  computed separately.
- C29-C31 fonts/layout, gateway override, tooling: Roboto via Fontsource,
  D9, D14, Vitest + Playwright + fflate release script.
